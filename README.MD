# jitsi.rocks Website & Resources


## Setup
### Jitsi Instances
Jitsi on Ubuntu 18.04 & Debian 10.
### Status Page
Cachet! \o/
### Website
Just plain HTML, CSS & JS. No PHP.
Special thanks to HTML5UP!
### Randomizer
Some php script (randomserver/index.php).
Has an array (`$urls`) and an array_rand (`$url`).
It then forms `$forwardedurl` from the array and put's the variable into the Forwarding string.
Quick and dirty, but cheaper then an F5 appliance. ;)
